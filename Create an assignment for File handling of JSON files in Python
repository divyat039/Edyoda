Input- Creating a JSON file of employee information and reading it into a list of objects:

import json

class Employee:
    def __init__(self, name, dob, height, city, state):
        self.name = name
        self.dob = dob
        self.height = height
        self.city = city
        self.state = state

# Creating a JSON file with employee information
employees = [
    {
        "name": "John Doe",
        "dob": "1995-05-15",
        "height": 175,
        "city": "New York",
        "state": "NY"
    },
    {
        "name": "Jane Smith",
        "dob": "1990-10-10",
        "height": 163,
        "city": "Los Angeles",
        "state": "CA"
    },
    {
        "name": "Bob Johnson",
        "dob": "1985-03-25",
        "height": 180,
        "city": "Chicago",
        "state": "IL"
    },
    {
        "name": "Mary Davis",
        "dob": "1992-12-01",
        "height": 167,
        "city": "Houston",
        "state": "TX"
    },
    {
        "name": "David Lee",
        "dob": "1988-06-20",
        "height": 172,
        "city": "San Francisco",
        "state": "CA"
    }
]

with open("employee.json", "w") as f:
    json.dump(employees, f)

# Reading the JSON file into a list of Employee objects
employee_objects = []
with open("employee.json", "r") as f:
    employee_data = json.load(f)
    for employee in employee_data:
        employee_objects.append(Employee(employee["name"], employee["dob"], employee["height"], employee["city"], employee["state"]))

# Printing the list of Employee objects
for employee in employee_objects:
    print("Name: {}, DOB: {}, Height: {}, City: {}, State: {}".format(employee.name, employee.dob, employee.height, employee.city, employee.state))

2. Creating a JSON file of Indian states and their capitals:

import json

# Creating a dictionary of Indian states and their capitals
indian_states = {
    "Andhra Pradesh": "Hyderabad",
    "Arunachal Pradesh": "Itanagar",
    "Assam": "Dispur",
    "Bihar": "Patna",
    "Gujarat": "Gandhinagar",
    "Maharashtra": "Mumbai",
    "Tamil Nadu": "Chennai"
}

# Writing the dictionary into a JSON file
with open("indian_states.json", "w") as f:
    json.dump(indian_states, f)

# Reading the JSON file into a dictionary
with open("indian_states.json", "r") as f:
    indian_states = json.load(f)

# Printing the dictionary
for state, capital in indian_states.items():
    print("{}: {}".format(state, capital))
