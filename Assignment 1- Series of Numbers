Write a Python program to count the number of even and odd numbers from a series of numbers.

Program-

numbers = (1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9) # Declaring the tuple
odd = 0
even = 0
for x in numbers:
        if not x % 2:
    	     even+=1
        else:
    	     odd+=1
print("Number of even numbers :",even)
print("Number of odd numbers :",odd)

Output -

Number of even numbers : 4
Number of odd numbers : 5
